000001|The early morning air felt cool and refreshing.
000002|I walked along the quiet street with a cup of tea in my hand.
000003|The postman delivered a small parcel just after nine.

000094|He adjusted the pillow behind his back.
000095|Soft music played from the speaker.
000096|The melody was calm and soothing.
000097|Eyes grew heavy with tiredness.
000098|She stifled a small yawn.
000099|It had been a long day.
000100|I decided it was time for bed.
000101|The hallway light cast a warm glow.
