01801|We left the park as the sun dipped lower in the sky.
01802|Shadows stretched long across the pavement.
01803|She suggested we stop for a quick coffee.
01804|A small café caught our eye.
01805|The sign read: “Open 08:00–18:00 Daily.”
01806|Inside, the aroma of freshly ground coffee filled the air.

01813|We took a seat near the window.
01814|People hurried past in the street outside.
01815|A cyclist rang his bell as he passed by.
01816|The rain from earlier had left puddles on the road.
01817|She remarked, “It’s drizzling again.”
01818|I nodded and sipped my coffee.
01819|A couple argued quietly nearby in hushed tones.
01820|I tried not to eavesdrop.
01821|The café radio played a soft jazz tune.
01822|The rhythm was calming.
01823|I glanced at the clock: 17:15.
01824|We had time for one more stop.

01842|The colours were vivid and serene.
01843|I took a photo with my phone.
01844|A small plaque detailed the artist’s background.
01845|It mentioned 1840 as his birth year.
01846|We moved to a nearby gallery with 20th-century art.
01847|Abstract works challenged our perception.
01848|Bright colours clashed intentionally.
01849|Shapes seemed to move on the canvas.
01850|We discussed each piece quietly.

01896|A ferry moved slowly, lights twinkling along the hull.
01897|We resumed our walk.
01898|Signs indicated “Footpath to Greenwich – 2 miles.”
01899|We decided to continue along the path.
01900|The path curved slightly along the embankment.
01901|Grass and wildflowers lined each side.
01902|Bees buzzed from flower to flower.
01903|A jogger passed us, headphones in place.
01904|We exchanged polite smiles.

01925|Our shoes crunched on gravel.
01926|We arrived at the lighthouse.
01927|Its white tower gleamed faintly in the evening light.

01929|We admired the view from the base.
01930|The river stretched into the distance.
01931|A ferry moved slowly along the water.
01932|Seagulls wheeled above.
01933|We took photos for memory’s sake.
01934|The lighthouse door was locked.
01935|We noted its opening hours: 10:00–16:00 daily.
